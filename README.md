# **Pac-Man in Python**  

## **ðŸ“Œ Overview**  
This project implements the classic **Pac-Man** game in Python, using **search algorithms** and **artificial intelligence** to determine the movement of both Pac-Man and the ghosts. The game demonstrates **pathfinding techniques** and **AI behaviors** in a grid-based environment.  

## **ðŸŽ® Gameplay**  
The goal of the game is for Pac-Man to **collect all the dots** on the map while avoiding the ghosts. His movement is determined by **search algorithms** and **AI strategies**.  

The game offers **two gameplay modes**:  
1. **Search Mode** â€“ Pac-Man uses search algorithms to find the best path.  
2. **Multi-Agent Mode** â€“ Includes AI for both Pac-Man and the ghosts, creating a more dynamic experience.  

## **Implemented Search Algorithms**  
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** â€“ Finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph.  
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)** â€“ Explores paths deeply before backtracking.  
- **A\* Search (A-Star)** â€“ Uses a heuristic to efficiently find the optimal route.  
- **Uniform Cost Search** â€“ Selects the best path based on cost.  

## **ðŸ›  Technologies Used**  
- **Python** â€“ The main programming language.  
- **Pygame** â€“ Used for the graphical interface and event handling.  
- **AI Algorithms** â€“ BFS, DFS, A\*, and Uniform Cost Search for pathfinding.
